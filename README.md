##Requirements

	PHP >= 5.4.0 (Entrust requires 5.4, this is an increase over Laravel's 5.3.7 requirement)
	MCrypt PHP Extension

##How to install
### Step 1: Get the code
#### Option 1: Git Clone

	git clone git://github.com/mrakodol/A2ZCMS.git a2zcms

#### Option 2: Download the repository

    https://github.com/mrakodol/A2ZCMS/archive/master.zip

### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies
#### Option 1: Composer is not installed globally

    cd a2zcms
	curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	php composer.phar install --dev
#### Option 2: Composer is installed globally

    cd a2zcms
	composer install --dev

If you haven't already, you might want to make [composer be installed globally](http://andrewelkins.com/programming/php/setting-up-composer-globally-for-laravel-4/) for future ease of use.

Please note the use of the `--dev` flag.

Some packages used to preprocess and minify assests are required on the development environment.

When you deploy your project on a production environment you will want to upload the ***composer.lock*** file used on the development environment and only run `php composer.phar install` on the production server.

This will skip the development packages and ensure the version of the packages installed on the production server match those you developped on.

NEVER RUN `php composer.phar update` ON YOUR PRODUCTION SERVER.

### Step 3: Configure Environments(optional)

Laravel 4 will load configuration files depending on your environment. Basset will also build collections depending on this environment setting.

Open ***bootstrap/start.php*** and edit the following lines to match your settings. You want to be using your machine name in Windows and your hostname in OS X and Linux (type `hostname` in terminal). Using the machine name will allow the `php artisan` command to use the right configuration files as well.

    $env = $app->detectEnvironment(array(

        'local' => array('your-local-machine-name'),
        'staging' => array('your-staging-machine-name'),
        'production' => array('your-production-machine-name'),

    ));

Now create the folder inside ***app/config*** that corresponds to the environment the code is deployed in. This will most likely be ***local*** when you first start a project.

You will now be copying the initial configuration file inside this folder before editing it. Let's start with ***app/config/app.php***. So ***app/config/local/app.php*** will probably look something like this, as the rest of the configuration can be left to their defaults from the initial config file:

    <?php

    return array(

        'url' => 'http://myproject.local',

        'timezone' => 'UTC',
    );

### Step 4: Configure Mailer

In the same fashion, copy the ***app/config/mail.php*** configuration file in ***app/config/local/mail.php***. Now set the `address` and `name` from the `from` array in ***config/mail.php***. Those will be used to send account confirmation and password reset emails to the users.
If you don't set that registration will fail because it cannot send the confirmation email.


### Step 5: Install CMS

Now that you have the environment configured, you need to create a database configuration for it. 
If you install A2ZCMS on your localhost in folder a2zcms, you can type on web browser: http://localhost/a2zcms/
And than finish the installation. Instalation would populate a database with tables and start-up data(you can delete that data later).


### Step 6: Make sure app/storage is writable by your web server.

If permissions are set correctly:

    chmod -R 775 app/storage

Should work, if not try

    chmod -R 777 app/storage

### Step 7: Start Page

####Admin login
You can login to admin part of A2ZCMS:

    username: username_from_install_proces
    password: password_from_install_proces

## Application Structure

The structure of this starter site is the same as default Laravel 4 with one exception.
This starter site adds a `library` folder. Which, houses application specific library files.
The files within library could also be handled within a composer package, but is included here as an example.

Controllers for Admin part located in admin folder in Controller folder in app folder. 
CMS have a custom make a page using custom function for main content and sidebar.
Implementation custom function for pages is located in BaseController and shows in all pages. 
When user go to some noncustom page(edit profile, messages,...) user get sidebar from first page.


### Production Launch

By default debugging is enabled. Before you go to production you should disable debugging in `app/config/app.php`

```
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Application Debug Mode
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | When your application is in debug mode, detailed error messages with
    | stack traces will be shown on every error that occurs within your
    | application. If disabled, a simple generic error page is shown.
    |
    */

    'debug' => false,
```

## Troubleshooting

### Site loading very slow

  composer dump-autoload --optimize

## Included Package Information
<a name="confide"></a>
## Confide Authentication Solution

Used for the user auth and registration. In general for user controllers you'll want to use something like the following:

    <?php

    use Zizaco\Confide\ConfideUser;

    class User extends ConfideUser {

    }

For full usage see [Zizaco/Confide Documentation](https://github.com/zizaco/confide)

<a name="entrust"></a>
## Entrust Role Solution

Entrust provides a flexible way to add Role-based Permissions to Laravel4.

    <?php

    use Zizaco\Entrust\EntrustRole;

    class Role extends EntrustRole
    {

    }

For full usage see [Zizaco/Entrust Documentation](https://github.com/zizaco/entrust)

<a name="ardent"></a>
## Ardent - Used for handling repetitive validation tasks.

Self-validating, secure and smart models for Laravel 4's Eloquent ORM

For full usage see [Ardent Documentation](https://github.com/laravelbook/ardent)

<a name="carbon"></a>
## Carbon

A fluent extension to PHPs DateTime class.

```php
<?php
printf("Right now is %s", Carbon::now()->toDateTimeString());
printf("Right now in Vancouver is %s", Carbon::now('America/Vancouver'));  //implicit __toString()
$tomorrow = Carbon::now()->addDay();
$lastWeek = Carbon::now()->subWeek();
$nextSummerOlympics = Carbon::createFromDate(2012)->addYears(4);

$officialDate = Carbon::now()->toRFC2822String();

$howOldAmI = Carbon::createFromDate(1975, 5, 21)->age;

$noonTodayLondonTime = Carbon::createFromTime(12, 0, 0, 'Europe/London');

$worldWillEnd = Carbon::createFromDate(2012, 12, 21, 'GMT');
```

For full usage see [Carbon](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon)

<a name="basset"></a>
## Basset

A Better Asset Management package for Laravel.

Adding assets in the configuration file `config/packages/jasonlewis/basset/config.php`
```php
'collections' => array(
        'public-css' => function($collection)
        {
            $collection->add('assets/css/bootstrap.min.css');
            $collection->add('assets/css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css');
        },
    ),
```

Compiling assets

    $ php artisan basset:build

I would recommend using development collections for development instead of compiling .

For full usage see [Using Basset by Jason Lewis](http://jasonlewis.me/code/basset/4.0)

<a name="presenter"></a>
## Presenter

Simple presenter to wrap and render objects. Think of it of a way to modify an asset for the view layer only.
Control the presentation in the presentation layer not in the model.

The core idea is the relationship between two classes: your model full of data and a presenter which works as a sort of wrapper to help with your views.
For instance, if you have a `User` object you might have a `UserPresenter` presenter to go with it. To use it all you do is `$userObject = new UserPresenter($userObject);`.
The `$userObject` will function the same unless a method is called that is a member of the `UserPresenter`. Another way to think of it is that any call that doesn't exist in the `UserPresenter` falls through to the original object.

For full usage see [Presenter Readme](https://github.com/robclancy/presenter)

<a name="generators"></a>
